# TodoApp
ToDo App: Setup todo app where the user creates a todo Item in the list.

### We use the following concepts in Android:

## MVVM+Clean Architecture :
  Enhances testability, separation of concerns, and maintainability. It enables scalable, modular codebases, promotes reusability, and improves collaboration by 
  clearly defining data flow and responsibilities.

## Coroutine and Flows:
  Coroutines and Flows in Android provide efficient background processing, simplify asynchronous programming, reduce boilerplate code, enhance readability, 
  and improve performance by leveraging structured concurrency and reactive streams.
  
## Dagger-Hilt Dependency:
  simplifies dependency injection in Android, reduces boilerplate code, improves testability, promotes modularity, enhances code maintainability, 
  and provides built-in Android-specific components for seamless integration and easier lifecycle management.

## Android Room persistence database:
  simplifies database management, ensures compile-time SQL validation, improves data access efficiency, reduces boilerplate code, enhances testability, 
  and integrates seamlessly with LiveData and ViewModel for reactive data handling
